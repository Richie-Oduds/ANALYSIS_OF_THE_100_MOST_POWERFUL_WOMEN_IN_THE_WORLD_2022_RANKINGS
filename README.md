### ABOUT THE DATA

The data is originally from https://www.forbes.com/lists/power-women but my dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devrimtuner/the-worlds-100-most-powerful-women, as a CSV file. The data shows their ranks in the world most powerful women, shows their age and country. The dataset is reliable, original and comprehensive. The source has their own licence over the dataset. All the files have consistent columns. Finally, It would be good to have some updated information about the age of some of the women in the dataset, because I had to do some research in order to find the particular age of some of the women in the dataset which was intially stored with an hyphen sign '-'. The dataset was determined by four main metrics: money, media, impact and spheres of influence. For political leaders, it weighed gross domestic products and populations; for corporate leaders, revenues and employee counts; and media mentions and reach of all. The result is a collection of women who are fighting the status quo.
